# ImageDifferentiator

**todo:**
- add ImageDataTypeList class to the app

- also finish thread functionality (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/811224/how-to-create-a-thread ?? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50070179/writing-to-a-text-file-i-o-error ??) ((just add spinners for img loads and we'll be ok))
- dont write findings in file just yet, coz multithreading is gonna be overwhelmed by it, make list where findings gonna be
- different image ratio squishing to check badly cropped images too
- far future: create gui for checking imgs in gui for deletion 'n' stuff
- write console app so can be called with params (drop imgs in it, and writes findings at the imgs location??)
